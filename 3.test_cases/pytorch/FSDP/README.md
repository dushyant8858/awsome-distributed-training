# Get Started Training Llama 2, Mixtral 8x7B, and Mistral Mathstral with PyTorch FSDP in 5 Minutes

This content provides a quickstart with multinode PyTorch [FSDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) training on Slurm and Kubernetes.
It is designed to be simple with no data preparation or tokenizer to download, and uses Python virtual environment.

## Tested Configurations

### Instance Profiles

This test case includes an [instance profile system](profiles/) that auto-detects
your EC2 instance type and configures GPU count, EFA networking, NCCL settings,
and FSDP memory optimizations automatically. The Slurm scripts source the
matching profile at runtime — no manual editing of `GPUS_PER_NODE` or EFA
variables needed. See [profiles/README.md](profiles/README.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

To run FSDP training, you will need to create a training cluster based on Slurm or Kubermetes with an [Amazon FSx for Lustre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/what-is.html)
You can find instruction how to create a Amazon SageMaker Hyperpod cluster with [Slurm](https://catalog.workshops.aws/sagemaker-hyperpod/en-US), [Kubernetes](https://catalog.workshops.aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks/en-US) or with in [Amazon EKS](../../1.architectures).
